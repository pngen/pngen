## Hi, I'm a systems engineer specializing in backend architecture, distributed workflows, and high-reliability software.

This portfolio demonstrates end-to-end implementation ability across five engineering ecosystems: Python, Go, Rust, TypeScript, and Java.  
Each project is a complete, production-shaped system — modular, testable, and designed with real-world scalability patterns.

### What I build
- Distributed workflow engines & DAG schedulers  
- Messaging systems and Kafka-based microservices  
- Data pipelines and ETL/stream processing systems  
- Runtime engines, state machines, and job orchestration layers  
- Configuration/consensus systems and backend service foundations  

### Portfolio Projects

### Contract Work
I take on backend, systems, and infrastructure-focused contract projects — architecture design, implementation, or complete feature delivery.  
Reach out if you need fast, production-ready engineering work.
